# Shift3D
Game based on ArmorGames' Shift game series.

I've never used any other game engine, so some aspects should be changed. If you have used other game engines and have suggestions, they would be welcome.

Any constructive or destructive criticisms on the code in general would also be appreciated.

## What
It's a revamp of a project I did some years ago with working but ugly code that only ran on windows. This is what the gameplay looked like:

The original windows only game can be downloaded here: https://mega.nz/#!mlgQRQKa!fftbyLQpDa45gwHw1S-9z2ogNx4kB8qeSqT3fWJoT8E

Install and run, the login was an unfinished feature for sharing levels, cancel out of that. Pause with 'P'.

## Why
The goal of this project is to keep implementing modern lighting techniques, and recreate the mechanics I had made in the original project but are now broken.
